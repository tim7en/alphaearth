# Urban Heat Island Analysis: Methods Summary

## Introduction

This study presents an enhanced resolution analysis of Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) intensity across major cities in Uzbekistan using advanced remote sensing techniques. The analysis employs a multi-dataset integration approach with 200m spatial resolution, representing a 5-fold improvement over traditional 1km MODIS-based studies.

**Research Objectives:**
- Quantify SUHI intensity with enhanced spatial detail (200m resolution)
- Assess temporal trends across 14 major Uzbekistan cities (2018-2024)
- Implement robust urban-rural classification using multiple global datasets
- Provide actionable insights for urban climate adaptation

## Methodology

### Study Area and Cities
The analysis covers 14 major urban centers in Uzbekistan, including:
- **National Capital**: Tashkent
- **Republic Capital**: Nukus (Karakalpakstan)
- **Regional Centers**: Andijan, Bukhara, Samarkand, Namangan, Jizzakh, Qarshi, Navoiy, Termez, Gulistan, Nurafshon, Fergana, Urgench

### SUHI Calculation Framework
Surface Urban Heat Island intensity is calculated as:
```
SUHI = LST_urban - LST_rural
```

Where:
- **LST_urban**: Mean land surface temperature within urban core
- **LST_rural**: Mean land surface temperature in rural reference ring (25km buffer)

### Enhanced Resolution Processing
**Key Innovation**: 200m spatial resolution analysis (vs. traditional 1km)
- **Target Scale**: 200m for all integrated datasets
- **Quality Enhancement**: Increased minimum pixel requirements (Urban: 10 pixels, Rural: 25 pixels)
- **Statistical Robustness**: Enhanced sample sizes for reliable statistics

### Multi-Dataset Urban Classification
The study integrates 5 global datasets for robust urban-rural delineation:

1. **Google Dynamic World V1** (10m native)
   - Built-up probability mapping
   - Near real-time updates
   - Weight: 40% in composite

2. **Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL)** 
   - Built-up surface percentage
   - Global consistency
   - Weight: 30% in composite

3. **ESA WorldCover** (10m native)
   - High-accuracy land cover (Built-up class: 50)
   - Recent global coverage (2020-2021)
   - Weight: 20% in composite

4. **MODIS Land Cover Type** (500m native)
   - Long-term consistency
   - Urban class: 13
   - Weight: 15% in composite

5. **GLAD Global Land Cover** (30m native)
   - Detailed urban sub-classes (10, 11)
   - Additional validation
   - Weight: 5% in composite

### Temporal Framework
- **Analysis Period**: 2018-2024 (7 years)
- **Seasonal Focus**: Warm season emphasis (June-August)
- **Temporal Resolution**: Annual composites
- **Quality Control**: Comprehensive cloud masking and quality filtering

## Data Description

**MODIS Land Surface Temperature (MOD11A2 v6.1)**
- **Resolution**: 1km native, resampled to 200m
- **Temporal**: 8-day composites
- **Variables**: Day and night LST
- **Processing**: Proper scaling (×0.02) and Celsius conversion (-273.15)
- **Quality**: QC-based filtering for good quality data only

### Ancillary Environmental Data
**Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 (Landsat 8/9)**
- **Resolution**: 30m native, resampled to 200m
- **Variables**: Surface reflectance bands, derived vegetation indices
- **Quality Control**: QA_PIXEL cloud and shadow masking
- **Derived Indices**:
  - NDVI: (NIR-Red)/(NIR+Red) - Vegetation vigor
  - NDBI: (SWIR1-NIR)/(SWIR1+NIR) - Built-up detection

**Global Surface Water (GSW v1.4)**
- **Resolution**: 30m native, resampled to 200m
- **Purpose**: Water body masking (<25% occurrence threshold)
- **Coverage**: Global water occurrence mapping

### City-Specific Optimization
**Adaptive Thresholds**: Different cities require customized parameters due to varying urban morphologies:

```python
# Example: Bukhara (Traditional Architecture)
CITY_SPECIFIC_THRESHOLDS = {
    'Bukhara': {
        'urban_threshold': 0.01,   # Very low threshold
        'rural_threshold': 0.10,   # Avoid irrigation misclassification
        'ndvi_urban_max': 0.8,     # Relaxed vegetation constraint
        'ring_km': 15,             # Smaller rural reference ring
        'reason': 'Traditional urban morphology poorly captured by global datasets'
    }
}
```
