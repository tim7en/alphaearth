# Scope & Methods

## Objectives (per module)
- Soil Moisture: irrigation efficiency, water-stress mapping, yield correlations
- Afforestation: site suitability, survival modeling, canopy recovery monitoring
- Degradation: desertification trends, drivers
- Riverbank: erosion, encroachment, sand mining flags
- Protected Areas: illegal logging/roads/mining detection
- Biodiversity: habitat loss, fragmentation, species risk
- Urban Heat: UHI downscaling to ~10 m

## Methods
- EDA, clustering, change detection, regression/classification, trend analysis
- Sensitivity & uncertainty quantification
- Cross-module synthesis & policy translation
