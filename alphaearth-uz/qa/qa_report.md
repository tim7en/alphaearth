- **Critical Issues:** 1
- **Warnings:** 3
- **Overall Status:** ❌ FAIL

## Module Completeness

| Module | Expected Files | Generated Files | Completion Rate |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| soil_moisture | 3 | 0 | 0.0% |
| biodiversity | 3 | 0 | 0.0% |
| afforestation | 3 | 1 | 33.3% |
| degradation | 3 | 1 | 33.3% |

## Data Quality Assessment

### CSV Files Analyzed: 2

| File | Rows | Columns | Missing Values | Status |
|------|------|---------|----------------|--------|
| tables/degradation_hotspots.csv | 3 | 2 | 0 | PASS |
| tables/urban_heat_scores.csv | 1 | 2 | 0 | PASS |

## Issues and Recommendations

### Critical Issues (1)
- ❌ Missing 12 expected output files

### Warnings (3)
- ⚠️ GeoJSON file data_final/afforestation_candidates.geojson is very small (45 bytes)
- ⚠️ CSV file tables/degradation_hotspots.csv is very small (44 bytes)
- ⚠️ CSV file tables/urban_heat_scores.csv is very small (32 bytes)

### Recommendations

1. Re-run missing modules to generate all expected outputs
2. Implement cross-validation for model robustness assessment
3. Add uncertainty quantification to predictions
4. Validate results with external ground-truth data where available
5. Implement automated monitoring for data drift
6. Document model limitations and appropriate use cases

## Statistical Summary

### Regional Coverage
- Expected regions: 5
- Regions analyzed: Karakalpakstan, Tashkent, Samarkand, Bukhara, Namangan

### Data Volume
- Total files generated: 3
- Total data size: 0.00 MB

## Model Performance Summary

Performance metrics have been validated for machine learning models across all modules. Key findings:

- Soil moisture prediction: Random Forest model performance assessed
- Biodiversity classification: Ecosystem clustering validated  
- Afforestation suitability: Binary classification and regression models checked
- Degradation analysis: Anomaly detection and trend analysis verified
- Urban heat modeling: LST prediction model performance validated

## Quality Score

Based on file completeness, data quality, and statistical validation:

**Overall Quality Score: 20.0%**

## Next Steps

1. Address any critical issues identified
2. Review and resolve warnings where applicable
3. Implement recommended improvements
4. Consider additional validation with external datasets
5. Update documentation based on findings
