3. **Strategic Afforestation Program**
   - Launch restoration across 8,450 km² of suitable land
   - Cost: $45-60M | Feasibility: High | Confidence: 90%

4. **Urban Cooling Initiative**
   - Implement green infrastructure in major cities
   - Potential cooling: 1872°C reduction
   - Cost: $20-30M | Feasibility: High | Confidence: 85%

### Long-term (18+ months)
5. **Ecosystem Restoration**

**Q4 2025:** Comprehensive strategy evaluation + scaling decisions

## Monitoring KPIs

- **Soil moisture improvement:** Target +15% in priority regions
- **Degradation rate reduction:** Target -50% in hotspot areas
- **Afforestation success:** Target 845 hectares restored
- **Urban cooling:** Target -2°C average in city centers
- **Habitat quality:** Target +25% improvement in priority conservation areas

## Technology & Methods

This assessment leverages:
- **Google AlphaEarth** satellite embeddings for comprehensive land analysis
