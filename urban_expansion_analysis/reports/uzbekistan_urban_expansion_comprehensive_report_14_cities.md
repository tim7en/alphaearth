## 🔬 METHODOLOGY & DATA PROCESSING

### **Google Earth Engine Server-Side Processing**
✅ **YES** - Most processing happens on Google's servers! This analysis leverages:

- **Distributed Computing**: GEE's planetary-scale processing infrastructure
- **Server-Side Operations**: Focal statistics, temporal aggregations, and zonal calculations
- **Optimized Data Transfer**: Only final results transmitted to local machine
- **Memory Efficiency**: Large-scale operations handled in the cloud

### **Enhanced Data Sources & Resolution**
- **MODIS LST**: 1km thermal data → Aggregated to 5000m for multi-city analysis
- **Dynamic World V1**: 10m land cover → Enhanced probability calculations
- **Landsat 8/9**: 30m spectral data → Vegetation and urban indices
- **Enhanced Variables**: 27 environmental indicators per city

### **Spatial Coverage & Temporal Analysis**
- **Cities Analyzed**: 14 major urban centers (focused urban core areas)
- **Buffer Zones**: 4-10km radius per city (reduced for urban core focus)
- **Sample Points**: 50 samples per period × 10 periods = 500 total per city
- **Total Samples**: 7000 data points across focused urban areas
- **Temporal Range**: Annual analysis from 2016-2025 (10-year change detection with year-to-year tracking)
- **Spatial Resolution**: 100m analysis (enhanced from 200m for urban core detail)
