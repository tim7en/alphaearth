# Scientific Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) Analysis - Uzbekistan Cities

## Executive Summary

This analysis quantifies surface urban heat island intensity (SUHI) for 3 major cities in Uzbekistan using scientifically defensible remote sensing methods. SUHI is calculated as the difference in land surface temperature (LST) between urban cores and nearby rural rings during the warm season (June-August).

## Methodology

### Data Sources and Processing
- **MODIS LST**: MOD11A2 V6.1 8-day composites, properly scaled (0.02 K) and converted to °C
- **Landsat 8/9**: Collection-2 Level-2 surface reflectance with QA_PIXEL cloud masking
- **Dynamic World V1**: 10m land cover probabilities for urban/rural classification
- **Analysis Scale**: 1000m (MODIS native resolution) with explicit aggregation
- **Temporal Focus**: Warm season (JJA) median composites to avoid seasonal bias

### SUHI Calculation
Urban cores defined using Dynamic World built-up probabilities (threshold > 0.15), with rural rings at 15km distance (built-up probability < 0.05, water < 0.1). SUHI calculated separately for day and night as:

**SUHI = LST_urban - LST_rural**

### Quality Assurance
- Server-side processing via Google Earth Engine reduceRegions
- Proper Landsat L2 cloud/shadow masking using QA_PIXEL bits
- MODIS LST scaling and offset correction
- Scale-consistent analysis at 1km resolution
- Warm season filtering for temporal consistency

- Range Night SUHI Change: -0.103 to 1.353°C

**Urban Expansion Metrics:**
- Mean Urban Built-up Change: 0.0035 ± 0.0031
- Mean Rural Built-up Change: 0.0035 ± 0.0031

**Vegetation Changes:**
- Mean Urban NDVI Change: 0.0542 ± 0.0736
- Mean Rural NDVI Change: 0.0534 ± 0.0727

### City-Level Results

| City | SUHI Day Change (°C) | SUHI Night Change (°C) | Urban Built Change | Rural Built Change |
|------|---------------------|----------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Tashkent | 1.194 | 1.353 | 0.0070 | 0.0070 |
| Samarkand | 0.408 | 0.372 | 0.0023 | 0.0023 |
| Namangan | 0.907 | -0.103 | 0.0012 | 0.0012 |


## Technical Implementation

### Server-Side Processing
This analysis leverages Google Earth Engine's distributed computing infrastructure:
- Zonal statistics computed server-side using grouped reducers
- Minimal data transfer (only aggregated results)
- Scale-aware processing at 1km resolution
- Proper handling of mixed-resolution datasets

### Data Quality Metrics
- Analysis Scale: 1000m
- Warm Season: [] (June-July-August)
- Urban Threshold: Built probability > 0.15
- Rural Threshold: Built probability < 0.05
- Ring Width: 15 km
- Cities Analyzed: 3
- Analysis Span: 6 years

## Scientific Validity

This methodology follows established remote sensing literature for satellite SUHI analysis:
1. **Proper SUHI Definition**: Urban-rural LST difference (not weighted by built-up probability)
2. **Scale Consistency**: All variables aggregated to 1km MODIS scale
3. **Quality Control**: Comprehensive cloud masking and proper scaling
4. **Seasonal Control**: Warm season focus to avoid bias
5. **Server-Side Efficiency**: Leverages EE's distributed computing

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- MODIS LST resolution (1km) may not capture fine-scale urban heterogeneity
- Dynamic World accuracy varies by land cover type
- Rural ring definition assumes static rural characteristics
- Analysis limited to clear-sky conditions due to thermal remote sensing constraints

## Recommendations

1. **Urban Planning**: Consider SUHI intensity in green infrastructure planning
2. **Climate Adaptation**: Focus cooling strategies on cities with highest SUHI increases
3. **Monitoring**: Establish regular SUHI monitoring using this methodology
4. **Validation**: Ground-based temperature measurements for validation
